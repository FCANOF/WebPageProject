# ATS Pod 5 Project
**Frida Cano Falc√≥n**

## Discovering the World - Articles Page

This project is a web page showcasing various articles categorized by subjects such as travel, work, lifestyle, food, and business. Each article is displayed in a card format, including an image, title, subject, brief description, and action buttons for editing or deleting articles. The page is responsive and styled using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.


## Project Overview

### Features
- **Article Cards**: Each card displays the article's image, title, subject, and a brief description.
- **Action Buttons**: Each card includes icons for editing and deleting the article.
- **Subject Filters**: Buttons below the title "Discovering the World" allow users to filter articles by subject.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens using Bootstrap for responsive design.

### Main Components
- **HTML (index.html)**: Defines the structure of the webpage, including the card layout and filter buttons.
- **CSS (styles.css)**: Styles the page, providing positioning, color, and font settings, along with overlay effects for the cards.
- **JavaScript (scripts.js)**: Contains JavaScript code for interactivity (in the current form, this is limited to front-end display).
- **Icons**: Edit and delete icons on each card use URLs for the pencil and trash can images.
